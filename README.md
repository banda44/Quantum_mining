Quantum Mining System
Welcome to the Quantum Mining System! This project is designed to simulate a decentralized mining platform where users can register, mine Quantum Units, and perform transactions securely using a lightweight web-based interface.
Features
Registration: Users can register and generate unique Quantumgrafic IDs for secure transactions.
Mining: Earn Quantum Units based on real-time weather and electromagnetic wave conditions.
Transactions: Send Quantum Units to other miners through a secure platform.
Balance Checking: View your Quantum Units balance easily.
Web Interface: Interact with the system via a user-friendly HTML-based interface.


Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/banda44/Quantum_mining.git
cd Quantum_mining

2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Application
Start the application by running:

bash
Copy code
python Quantum_mining.py



4. Access the Interface
Open your browser and go to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:5000


Usage
Registration
Go to the registration page.
Enter your details to generate a Quantumgrafic ID.
Use your Quantumgrafic ID for logging in and mining.
Mining
Log in using your Quantumgrafic ID.
Start mining Quantum Units.
Rewards are based on real-time weather and electromagnetic wave data.
Transactions
Use the "Make Transaction" page to send Quantum Units.
Enter the recipient's Quantumgrafic ID and amount.
Confirm the transaction to complete it.
Checking Balance
Go to the "Check Balance" page.
Enter your Quantumgrafic ID to view your balance.
